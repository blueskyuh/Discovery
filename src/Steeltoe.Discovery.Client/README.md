# Steeltoe Discovery Client

This project contains the Steeltoe Discovery Client.  This client provides a generalized interface to service registries.  

Currently the client only supports [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server), but in the future we will support additional service registries.

For more information on how to use this component see the online [Steeltoe documentation](http://steeltoe.io/).
